## ü§ñ LLM & AI Model Terms

### **API Key**
A secret token used to authenticate with AI model providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, HuggingFace). Required for making API calls to cloud-based models.

### **Assistant**
In conversational AI, the AI model's role when responding to user queries. Part of the chat message format alongside "system" and "user" roles.

### **Attention Mechanism**
The core technology in transformer models that allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input when generating responses. Foundation of modern LLMs.

### **Checkpoint**
A saved state of a model during training, allowing for model versioning and rollback. Important for model management and A/B testing.

### **Chat Completion**
The process of an LLM generating a response to a conversation thread. The primary interface for most modern LLMs.

### **Completion**
The text output generated by an LLM in response to a prompt. Also called "generation" or "response."

### **Context Length / Context Window**
The maximum number of tokens an LLM can process in a single request, including both input and output. Varies by model (e.g., GPT-4: 8K-128K tokens).

### **Few-Shot Learning**
Providing a few examples in the prompt to help the model understand the desired task format. More examples than zero-shot, fewer than fine-tuning.

### **Fine-Tuning**
Training a pre-trained model on specific data to adapt it for particular tasks or domains. Creates specialized model versions.

### **Frequency Penalty**
A parameter that reduces the likelihood of the model repeating the same words or phrases. Higher values promote more diverse vocabulary.

### **Hallucination**
When an LLM generates false, misleading, or fabricated information that appears confident and plausible. A key evaluation target.

### **Inference**
The process of using a trained model to generate predictions or responses. In LLMs, this means generating text from prompts.

### **Instruct Model**
An LLM specifically trained to follow instructions and respond helpfully to user requests. Examples: GPT-4, Claude, Llama-2-Chat.

### **Large Language Model (LLM)**
A neural network trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text. Examples: GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA.

### **Model**
The AI system being evaluated. In this framework, refers to specific LLM variants (e.g., "gpt-4", "ollama/llama2").

### **Model Grading / Model-as-a-Judge**
Using one LLM to evaluate the outputs of another LLM. Useful for complex evaluations where exact matching isn't sufficient.

### **Presence Penalty**
A parameter that encourages the model to explore new topics by penalizing tokens that have already appeared in the text.

### **Prompt**
The input text given to an LLM to elicit a response. Can include instructions, context, examples, and questions.

### **Prompt Engineering**
The practice of crafting effective prompts to get desired behaviors from LLMs. Critical for evaluation template design.

### **System Message**
A special prompt that sets the behavior, role, or constraints for the AI model. Typically processed first and influences all subsequent responses.

### **Temperature**
A parameter controlling randomness in model outputs. Lower values (0.0-0.3) make outputs more deterministic, higher values (0.7-1.0) more creative.

### **Token**
The basic unit of text processing in LLMs. Roughly 4 characters or 0.75 words in English. Used for billing and context limits.

### **Top-p (Nucleus Sampling)**
A sampling method that considers only the tokens comprising the top-p probability mass. Alternative to temperature for controlling randomness.

### **Transformer**
The neural network architecture underlying most modern LLMs. Introduced the attention mechanism that revolutionized natural language processing.

### **Zero-Shot Learning**
Asking an LLM to perform a task without providing any examples in the prompt. Tests the model's general understanding.
